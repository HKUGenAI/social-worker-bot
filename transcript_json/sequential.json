Into something that's not your thoughts and not your feelings. And so what I did, I reminded you that you were safe and that you were here in the room and that it was 2012. And then I got you to look around the room and actually have a look at what was going on around you. So that's something that you can actually start to use yourself a little bit.

It's about, what it's about it getting you to breathe how a relaxed person breathes. So you know, a person who's stressed and upset and anxious, you know, they breathe shallow or they'll hold their breathe. People who are relaxed, you know, when we're relaxed we tend to breathe more deeply and more slowly. And that actually sends out, makes our bodies relax too. So for people who are anxious if they can start to breathe more like, more, in a more relaxed fashion, often they can start to feel more relaxed."

And then I'll just ask you to do a few things about noticing your breathing and changing it. That's great. Okay. So, as you're just sitting there relaxed just become aware, that's it. Get comfy and just become aware of breathing in and breathing out. Just your normal breathing. And just notice how long it takes for each in breathe and each out breathe. Just be aware of that. That's great. Just noticing how long it takes. You're breathing through your nose, that's terrific. And now just start to breathe in a little more deeply. Get it down, going down further into your belly. So, you'll probably feel, you should feel your belly rise as you get it in deeper. It's not always easy to do. It's something that can take a bit of practice So just see how much deeper you can get. And the other thing is that quite often when people first start doing this they might feel a little bit dizzy. So it's good to practice it when you're sitting down. Feel a bit dizzy to start with is normal. And that's okay and over time it will pass. So just getting in a bit deeper, that's great. Just imagine getting the air right down to your belly and gradually feeling the rest of your lungs and your chest up. Some people like the air kind of coming in like a wave and filling up their belly and then leaving their belly and coming all the way out again. You're doing really well there. Getting nice and deep there. And now the next step is to see if you can slow that breathing down a little bit. Just slow it down a bit, keeping it nice and deep. And let it out, and in, a little pause and let it out again. Just as slow as you can get it. You're doing really, really well. Nice and slow. Nice and deep. That's great. Now just whenever you're ready Julia, just gently open your eyes. Have a little look around the room. And we can talk about what it was like for you doing that breathing. Yeah?"

Now Julia, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get you to imagine, to start with that you're walking down a path in the bush. And as you're walking down the path, just notice the trees around you. Notice your feet crunching on some leaves underneath them. Notice the feel of the air, warm but not too warm. Slight breeze. Notice that the sky's blue, a couple of tiny little clouds floating around. It's a beautiful day. Notice walking along down this path you're feeling kind of pretty good walking down along this path. And you see up ahead of you a very large limestone wall with a door in it. Quite a big door with a sort of arched frame around it. And as you come closer you realize it's actually a doorway and you look through, you come up to it and you look through the door way. And you see a set of stone stairs leading down. And as you stand at the top of the stairs you've got a feeling if you walk down those stairs there's going to be something very, very nice at the bottom of them. And you really want to walk down them. And so just let yourself start to walk down the stairs. And with every step you take you find yourself feeling better and better, more calm, more centered, more happy, lighter, and you continue to walk down each step. Just feeling better, and better, and calmer, and calmer. More and more relaxed with every step. Continue walking down the steps one after the other. Now you've just got three steps to go. So just take those three steps one after the other. And now you find yourself at the bottom of the stairs feeling very calm, very relaxed, really happy, really light with not cares at all. And you look around you and in front of you, you see a grassy expanse and just beyond that grassy expanse, it's not very wide, you see a lake. Just walk out across the grass looking around you. Walk towards the lake. Noticing everything that you can see. Notice that there's lots of shady trees. You can hear birds in the trees. Notice that you can hear the sound of quacking ducks. And as you look out across the lake you can see a mother duck with a few little baby ducks following her. And as you look further around the lake you can see that there are quite a few ducks around the place. Just all happily floating around the lake. Just pedaling underneath the water. Continue to look around and notice everything else that you can see. Have a look and see if there's a seat for you to have a set down on. Or where there's a nice patch of shade under a tree that you would like to sit down on. Jut explore everything that you can see and hear, and smell in this beautiful safe place that you've found yourself. You're completely safe here, there's absolutely nothing to hurt you, there are just ducks. And if you look really closely you might even see a little rabbit poking its nose out of some undergrowth. It's all very calm, very safe, and you can truly relax here because you are just really safe. And the air's warm, sky's blue, it's just beautiful. You feel calm and relaxed. So just get yourself comfortable there in your safe place. Make any changes to it that you like to, to make it even more safe, more calm, and more relaxed for you. Just explore everything there. And just notice how you feel while you're there in your safe place. Just notice the feeling of calm. Notice the feeling feeling of safety. Notice the feeling of relaxation. Notice how it feels in your body and just enjoy it. And now really being aware of that, that feeling you've got, the feeling of safety, and calm and relaxation. And knowing that you can come back to this safe place whenever you want. Just gently start to make your way back to the stairs. You're walking across the lawn, the grass, and you feeling really, really good. And you know you can come back here whenever you want. And knowing that just walk gently up the stairs and as you walk the stairs you're continuing to feel really safe, really calm, really continent, really relaxed. And you keep on walking up the stairs and now you come out through the door, through the big doorway at the top of the stairs, and you're now back onto the bush track. And just start to walk down that bush track, still feeling very, very calm, continent, relaxed, and safe. And still feeling all those lovely feelings. Whenever you're ready just open your eyes and come back into the room. And when you're ready let me know what that experience was like."

So, just to start with, we'll do the nostril one. So just, just notice the sensations around your nostrils as you breath in and as you breath out. You might be aware that the air is slightly cooler as it goes in. Slightly warmer as it goes out. Some people can feel the air going across their upper lip, other people can't. And as you focus on the air going in and out of your nostrils, again if you're like everybody else there will be all sorts of thoughts that start floating into your mind or some people rushing into your mind. And when they come into your mind just gently acknowledge them, notice what they are, but don't go with them. Just let them go and bring your attention back to the air going in and out of your nostrils. Know that it's normal to have thoughts floating around in your mind trying to drag your attention away. That's what our minds do. And knowing that it's also normal to maybe feel some irritation that they won't stop. And if you feel some irritation and you find yourself saying, \"Oh, this is stupid.\" or \"This is annoying.\" Just notice that. That's another thought. Don't judge it, don't be upset with yourself. Don't be angry at the thought. Just, they're all just thoughts. Just acknowledge them, let them go, and bring your attention back to the air going in and out of your nostrils."

You might notice your chest raising. Just notice it as it goes in and out. And again, just notice any thoughts that float through your mind. Gently acknowledge them. Be gently, don't judge them, and just let them go. And bring your attention back to the air going in and out of your lungs. And if you find yourself judging a thought, just note it. That's all, I'm judging that thought. And then let, that's another thought and let that thought go. And just keep your attention on the air going in and out of your lungs.
